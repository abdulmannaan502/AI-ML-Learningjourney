# ðŸ“š NLP Core Concepts â€“ Learning Progress

## âœ… What Iâ€™ve Learned

Iâ€™ve completed my study of the **core concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This includes understanding the foundational theories, techniques, and tools that power modern language-based AI systems.

### Covered Topics:
- What is NLP and its real-world applications
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopwords)
- Vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Language models (n-grams, statistical models, transformers)
- Sentiment analysis basics
- Introduction to NLP libraries (like NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This README is part of my ongoing **#100DaysOfAI** journey.
